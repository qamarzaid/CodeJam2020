####  Problem: Vestigium
```
Vestigium means "trace" in Latin. In this problem we work with Latin squares and matrix traces.

The trace of a square matrix is the sum of the values on the main diagonal (which runs from the upper left to the lower right).

An N-by-N square matrix is a Latin square if each cell contains one of N different values, and no value is repeated within a row or a column. In this problem, we will deal only with "natural Latin squares" in which the N values are the integers between 1 and N.

Given a matrix that contains only integers between 1 and N, we want to compute its trace and check whether it is a natural Latin square. To give some additional information, instead of simply telling us whether the matrix is a natural Latin square or not, please compute the number of rows and the number of columns that contain repeated values.
